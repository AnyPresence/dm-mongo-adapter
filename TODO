Add support for:

- aggregation functions: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Aggregation

- offset option for queries

- declaring indexes: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Indexes

  User.index :foo

- querying based on an embedded resource properties, ie:

  User.all(:address => { :street => 'foo' })

  which should run a following query using the driver:

  find('address.street' => 'foo')) }

- authentication: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Security+and+Authentication

General stuff:

- figure out how to include the shared adapter spec from dm-core and overwrite Heffalump model so it will work fine

- organize specs in groups (public/semipublic like in dm-core maybe?)

- improve test coverage, especially for embedded resources and handling of custom types

- add MongoMapper-style of typecasting objects, like Date.to_mongo etc.

- finish mysql vs mongodb performance script based on the one from dm-core

- update README

- clean up and document the code

- write a basic tutorial


And a big one:

 figure out what needs to be improved in dm-core so there won't be a need to override its private API :)
